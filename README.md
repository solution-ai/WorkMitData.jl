# WorkMitData

This package contains some utility functions to work with data in a data analysis task in Julia.

*WorkMitData.jl* also reexport DataFrames and StatsBase.

> Note that WorkMitData.jl overwrites some functions in Base and Statistics. The overwriting is to suit those functions better for dealing with missing values.
